Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  The DriverPass project had a client who was the owner, Liam. He wanted to develop a system to effectively teach kids how to drive and provide opportunities to get driving experience. This is a web-based system over the cloud to be accessed from a multitude of devices. 
  
What did you do particularly well?
  I felt like I made the diagrams really well. They were easy to understand and concise.
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would improve my technical requirements. I had some trouble coming up with specifics. I would improve this by spending more time coming up with specifics for the requirements and expand the information more.
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I thought the interview helped a lot in figuring out the users needs. This allowed some time to sit down with the client and get the details to develop this project effectively. It is important to consider the user's needs because if you do not, then customer satisfaction drops immediately.
  
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  I have a methodical approach when designing software. I will typical design the systems that everything relies on first. For example if the "main" needs two functions to run, I would design those two functions first before writing the main function.
